# Mallard_Visualizer
This is a command line visualizer that I wrote (with some ai assistance)  that you can route any sort of audio (chrome, fl studio under wine) using  qpwgraph. I embarked on this project because I am a music producer and aspiring electronics engineer and I want to learn how things work also I've been coding since I was 13 or so. (Born in 03)
